            Born in Jamaica, the youngest of thirteen children, SIMEON JOHNSON overcame much hardship. As a young child, he witnessed his motherâ€™s death; as a teenager, he endured myriad hardships and even came to the brink of suicide. Who, then would have said God blessed Simeon? Yet now he has returned to testify to the world and the testimony of the Cross.
